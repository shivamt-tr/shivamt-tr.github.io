<div style="text-align: justify"> <p>
I am an MS (By Research) student in the department of <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in">Computer Science and Engineering</a> at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT Kanpur). I have recently joined as a Senior Engineer in the Visual Intelligence group at Samsung R&D Institute - Bangalore, India. For more details, please take a look at my <b><a href="/files/Shivam_Tripathi_Academic_CV_24_Sept_2024.pdf">CV</a></b>.
</p>

<p>
My research interest lies in Machine Learning and Computer Vision, I am particularly interested to work on multi-modal learning, representation learning, and creative image/video manipulation using generative AI. For my master's thesis I am working with <a href="https://grvsharma.com">Prof. Gaurav Sharma</a> on audio-guided face expression editing by leveraging the latent space of powerful generative models.
