<div style="text-align: justify"> <p>
I am an MS (By Research) student in the department of <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in">Computer Science and Engineering</a> at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT Kanpur). I have recently joined as a Senior Engineer in the Visual Intelligence group at Samsung R&D Institute - Bangalore, India. For more details, please take a look at my <b><a href="/files/Shivam_Tripathi_Academic_CV_9_Feb_2025.pdf">CV</a></b>.
</p>

<p>
My research interest lies in Machine Learning and Computer Vision, I am particularly interested to work on multi-modal learning, representation learning, and creative image/video manipulation using generative AI. For my master's thesis I am working with <a href="https://grvsharma.com">Prof. Gaurav Sharma</a> on audio-guided face expression editing by leveraging the latent space of powerful generative models.

  <span style="color:DimGray">MS Thesis, IIT Kanpur</span>
  * Advisor: <a href="https://grvsharma.com">Prof. Gaurav Sharma</a>
  * Developing an audio-visual stylization framework that modifies image styles based on audio semantics
  * Designed a hierarchical VQVAE model to invert input images into StyleGAN’s latent space, then perturbed the latent codes using a unified audio-visual feature space to generate stylized results
  * Implemented StyleGAN2 inversion, audio-visual feature alignment, and latent code editing
  * Built a pipeline to extract training data for audio-visual feature learning utilizing large-scale audio-visual datasets

* <b><span style="color:Chocolate">TensorTour (acquired by <a href="https://typeface.ai">Typeface.ai</a>)</span></b> <span style="color:DimGray">| May 2022 – July 2022</span>  
  <span style="color:DimGray">Research Intern | Remote</span>
  * Managed image metadata using SQLite, performed CRUD operations, and built a Flask API for content-based image retrieval, providing top-k similar images from user queries
  * Explored and conducted a comparative study of available neural image compression models

* <b><span style="color:Chocolate">Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata</span></b> <span style="color:DimGray">| Jan 2019 – Sep 2019</span>  
  <span style="color:DimGray">Research Intern | <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y0bopSoqO0E00y0sgvyxayq_m_HZVmfo?usp=sharing">Internship Letter</a></span>
  * Advisor: <a href="https://www.isical.ac.in/~nikhil/">Prof. Nikhil R. Pal</a>  
  * Conducted experiments leveraging self-organizing maps (SOMs) for 2D lattice projection with Sammon’s structure-preserving loss, selecting significant features while preserving lattice visualization
  * Experimented on t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and autoencoder-based latent representation methods to enhance visualization for datasets with complex manifolds
